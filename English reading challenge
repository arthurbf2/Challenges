1- Artificial general intelligence. Its purpose is to try to emulate human thinking and cognition on a machine, so that it can essencially behave like a human being,
learning and understanding any kind of problem humans face, though with much bigger brain processing power. There are a lot of AGI examples in pop culture, such as
Jarvis the AI(who later turns into superhero Vision), in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Arnold Schwarzenegger's character in Terminator, the hosts in HBO's show Westworld...

2- It consists in using machine learning to interpret human language, making human-computer interaction much simpler. It is already used almost everywhere. Some examples: 
Google Translate, predictive text and auto-correction on our phones, search engines, virtual assistants such as Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant.

3- AI, combined with 3D printers, have revolutionized prosthesis design. Text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies for people with visual impairments and/or
learning disabilities, and self-driving vehicles for people with physical disabilities.

4- The unemployment, that would then trigger huge social changes, because the fundamentals of the capitalist society most of the world lives in would be disrupted. 
When a big part of a population is unemployed, poverty and crime rates skyrocket, and the overall standart of living greatly diminishes, as mental andphysical 
health are also affected.
